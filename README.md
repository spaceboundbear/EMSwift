EMSwift

This application is a simple way for EMS and first responders to keep track of patients under their care. A user can store patient information, vitals, symptoms, view past patients, and retrieve local nearby hospitals with traffic updates to make an accurate decision on where to transport patients.

This app uses MapQuest and Endless Medical APIs
This app also keeps track of patients using local storage

Note: This is simply a proof of concept and does not comply with HIPAA standards and regulations; be aware that this is only for testing and not for actual use in the real world (for now).
